"misc" is a collection of the half done, the foolishly implemented, the demos, the obscure features, and the testcode.

The voice synthesis on loki is pretty terrible: everyone knows this. However not everyone knows it exists.

The implementation currently abuses Posix.system() in ways that would make you weep, but surprisingly fun for a 20min exercise.

./shell
##Fucking Tiny Loki
###dial in elementary loki.

An attempt to create an automatic script to remove a load of packages and surplus data. Would love some input on this and maybe one day suggestions on less demanding software and tuning tips for elderly/embedded hardware.
