#misc

###all the shit that's shit to shit.

"misc" is a collection of the half done, the foolishly implemented, the demos, the obscure features, and the testcode.

#./vala
##ShitTalker
###low effort speech synthesis toy.

The voice synthesis on loki is pretty terrible: everyone knows this. However not everyone knows it exists.

The implementation currently abuses Posix.system() in ways that would make you weep, but surprisingly fun for a 20min exercise.

##StopClock
###highly unfinished desktop timer

I needed a clock when no good option existed. This got the job done but the advanced features and sexy design never happened. Stay tuned.

#./shell
##Fucking Tiny Loki
###dial in elementary loki.

An attempt to create an automatic script to remove a load of packages and surplus data. Would love some input on this and maybe one day suggestions on less demanding software and tuning tips for elderly/embedded hardware.
